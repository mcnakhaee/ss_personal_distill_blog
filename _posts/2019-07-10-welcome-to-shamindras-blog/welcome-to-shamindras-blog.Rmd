## Welcome - Let's Get Statistical!

Hi there! I'm Shamindra and a graduate student in Statistics at the wonderful Carnegie Mellon University (Go Tartans!). I've decided to start blogging 
to document my learning and development in statistics as a new graduate student. 

I'd like it to be a fun place to document interesting things I like to read 
about in the statistics and machine learning space (`rstats`, `python`, `theory`)  as well as anything else I am into e.g. books, cricket (the Australian version of baseball) etc.

Please browse around, leave a (friendly) comment, and most importantly enjoy 
as we explore together!
