Hi there! I’m **Shamindra Shrotriya**, a graduate student in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/) at the
wonderful [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I’ve decided to start 
blogging to document my learning and development in statistics as a new 
graduate student.

I’d like it to be a fun place to document interesting things I like to 
read about in the statistics and machine learning space (`statistical theory/methodology research`, `rstats`, `python` etc) as well as anything else I am generally into e.g. books, sports.

Feel free to pull up a chair, leave a comment, and join me 
so that we can explore together `r emo::ji("100")`.
